## About the project
AI Solution Templates are a suite of pre-built blueprints that guide you through the full AI lifecycle on IBM Z with various enterprise use cases while leveraging a variety of technologies. Whether youâ€™re a senior data scientist or have no previous AI skills, build your own AI model, deploy it on IBM Z, and integrate it into a business application.
